INSTRUCTIONS:

You'll be given a random number at the beginning of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of         points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the             game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the value of each crystal.
